            Howdy! My name is Nicole Clements and I am a junior computing major at Texas A&M University in College Station, TX. 
            I grew up in Plano, TX and went to high school at the <a href="https://www.ursulinedallas.org/about/why-ursuline">Ursuline Academy of Dallas</a>. More details about my education, 
            work experience, and on-campus activities can be found under the "Qualifications" tab. I developed 
            a strong interest in the computer science industry after taking a few different programming classes offered by my 
            high school. This led me to apply to the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/about/index.html">College of Engineering</a> at Texas A&M University in hopes of developing the knowledge 
            necessary to succeed in a career in a computer science field. Samples of some of the work that I have done in my classes at A&M over 
            the past few years can be found under the “Technical Portfolio” tab. Outside of class, I have also gotten the 
            opportunity to join a few different on-campus organizations and spend time giving back to the local 
            community in Bryan-College Station. More details about my experiences with giving back to my community can be found 
            under the “Service” tab. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of class and my on-campus involvements, I spend my free time listening to music, going to sporting events, 
            spending time with my friends or family, and traveling. I have an especially strong passion for travel and have 
            been to eight different countries so far. Out of all the places that I have been, my favorite destination has been Australia.
            I was very fortunate to travel to Toowoomba, Australia on an educational and cultural delegation in high school. We visited our sister-school 
            there and I was able to stay in the home of one of their students for two weeks. I learned so much on this trip 
            and still keep in touch with my host-sister to this day. Through traveling, I have developed a global perspective and become comfortable with 
            taking risks. I am so grateful for the <a href="https://vimeo.com/user82269549">travel experiences</a> 
            that I have had thus far and am very excited to continue exploring the world in the future. 
            I hope to combine my computing knowledge and passion for travel by pursuing a career in the travel industry one day.
