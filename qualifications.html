        <a href="Nicole-Clements-Resume.pdf" download>Here</a> you can download my resume, which includes information about my education, work experience, 
        activities and skills. Through my rigorous computer science coursework, I have developed
        a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and data analysis. I have also gained experience
        working with several different programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python. 
        In the future, I would be interested in using these skills to explore application development.
        I believe that this would be a great way for me to apply my strong passion for problem-solving
        and making people's lives easier.

        My most recent work experience was as a wealth management intern at 
        <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us">Morgan Stanley</a>.
        This internship allowed me to gain useful business knowledge to supplement the computing 
        knowledge that I am developing in my classes. Another position that was very beneficial to my development 
        was working as a sales associate at <a href="https://www.shoplizardthicket.com/community-involvement">Lizard Thicket</a>. 
        This position gave me the opportunity to build 
        excellent communication skills. This job also allowed me to give back to my community, as one day every 
        month our store would donate 10% of our sales to a local charity. As far as my involvement in college, my involvement 
        in my sorority has had the most impact on me. Being a member of the <a href="https://tamu.kappa.org/">Epsilon Rho chapter of Kappa Kappa 
        Gamma</a> has allowed me to develop life-long friendships and important leadership skills.
