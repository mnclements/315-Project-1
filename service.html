            As a member of the philanthropy committee for the Epsilon Rho chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma, 
            I help work to raise a total of around $50,000 every school year. This money benefits both our national philanthropy, 
            The National Alliance on Mental Illness, and our local philanthropy, Books and a Blanket. Each semester, we 
            host an philanthropy event at our house with a raffle, food, and entertainment. If you would like to attend 
            this semester's event or donate to our philanthropies, please visit our <a href="https://kkg.crowdchange.co/26923">Crowd Change page</a>.
            To learn more about our philanthropies, visit <a href="https://nami.org/About-NAMI">NAMI.org</a> and the <a href="http://booksandablanket.squarespace.com/what-we-do">Books and a Blanket</a> website.

            This fall I am excited to be joining the digital team at <a href="https://letthemlive.org/">Let Them Live</a> as an unpaid intern.
            Let Them Live is a non-profit that supports pregnant women facing financial struggles. A 
            few of the ways that the organization helps mothers includes paying 
            for their rent or car payments, providing counseling, and helping them find employment. 
            They make this possible by hosting fundraisers for specific moms and accepting monthly 
            donations from generous donors. I will be helping the organization this semester with 
            optimizing their technology platforms.
