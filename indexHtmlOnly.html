      <!-- About Me Text (below pictures) -->
      <p> 
          Howdy! My name is Nicole Clements and I am a junior computing major at Texas A&M University in College Station, TX. 
          I grew up in Plano, TX and went to high school at the <a href="https://www.ursulinedallas.org/about/why-ursuline">Ursuline Academy of Dallas</a>. More details about my education, 
          work experience, and on-campus activities can be found under the "Qualifications" tab. In high school, I developed 
          a strong interest in the computer science industry after taking a few different programming classes offered by my 
          school. This led me to apply to the College of Engineering at Texas A&M University to prepare me with the knowledge 
          necessary to succeed in a career in the computer science field. Samples of some of the work that I have done over 
          the past few years can be found under the “Technical Portfolio” tab. Outside of class, I have also gotten the 
          opportunity to join a few different on-campus organizations at Texas A&M and spend time giving back to the local 
          community in Bryan-College Station. More details about my experiencing with giving back to my community can be found 
          under the “Service” tab. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Outside of class and my on-campus involvements, I spend my free time listening to music, going to sporting events, 
          spending time with my friends or family, and traveling. I have an especially strong passion for travel and have 
          been to eight different countries so far. My favorite destination so far is Australia. I was very fortunate to 
          travel to Australia on an educational and cultural delegation in high school. We visited our sister-school in 
          Toowoomba and I was able to stay with one of the students there for two weeks. I learned so much on this trip 
          and still keep in touch with my host-sister to this day. I am so grateful for the <a href="https://vimeo.com/user82269549">travel experiences</a> 
          that I have had so far and am very excited to continue exploring the world in the future. 
          I would love to combine to my passion for travel and computing knowledge in order to pursue a career in the travel industry one day.

      <div class = "portfolioImage1Text">
          <p>While studying at Texas A&M, I have completed a variety of different technical projects
          for my classes. For a project in a programming languages course, I simulated a <a href="Java.zip" download>market</a>, which 
          had buying and selling capabilities, and a <a href="Java.zip" download>messaging system</a> in Java.
          For a project in a data structures and algorithms course, I used C++ to create a <a href="C++.zip" download>binary search tree</a>, 
          output the tree as text, and calculate the average search cost of every node in the tree.</p> <p>In the future, 
          I would like to use my experience and technical skills to explore mobile app development. I would really like 
          to create a mobile app for a non-profit that I work with.</p>

  <p> 
      <a href="Nicole-Clements-Resume.pdf" download>Here</a> you can view my resume, which includes information about my education, work experience, 
      activities and skills. Through my rigorous computer science coursework, I have developed
      a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and data analysis. I have also gained experience
      working with several different programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python. 
      In the future, I would be interested in using these skills to explore application development.
      I believe that this would be a great way for me to apply my strong passion for problem-solving
      and making people's lives easier.
  </p>
  <p>
      My most recent work experience was as a wealth management intern at 
      <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us">Morgan Stanley</a>.
      This internship allowed me to gain useful business knowledge to supplement the computing 
      knowledge that I am developing in my classes. Another position that was very beneficial to my development 
      was working as a sales associate at <a href="https://www.shoplizardthicket.com/community-involvement">Lizard Thicket</a>. 
      This position gave me the opportunity to build 
      excellent communication skills. This job also allowed me to give back to my community, as one day every 
      month our store would donate 10% of our sales to a local charity. As far as my involvement in college, my involvement 
      in my sorority has had the most impact on me. Being a member of the <a href="https://tamu.kappa.org/">Epsilon Rho chapter of Kappa Kappa 
      Gamma</a> has allowed me to develop life-long friendships and important leadership skills.

          As a member of the philanthropy committee for the Epsilon Rho chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma, 
          I help work to raise a total of around $50,000 every school year. This money benefits both our national philanthropy, 
          The National Alliance on Mental Illness, and our local philanthropy, Books and a Blanket. Each semester, we 
          host an philanthropy event at our house with a raffle, food, and entertainment. If you would like to attend 
          this semester's event or donate to our philanthropies, please visit our <a href="https://kkg.crowdchange.co/26923">Crowd Change page</a>.
          To learn more about our philanthropies, visit <a href="https://nami.org/About-NAMI">NAMI.org</a> and the <a href="http://booksandablanket.squarespace.com/what-we-do">Books and a Blanket</a> website.

          This fall I am excited to be joining the digital team at <a href="https://letthemlive.org/">Let Them Live</a> as an unpaid intern.
          Let Them Live is a non-profit that supports pregnant women facing financial struggles. A 
          few of the ways that the organization helps mothers includes paying 
          for their rent or car payments, providing counseling, and helping them find employment. 
          They make this possible by hosting fundraisers for specific moms and accepting monthly 
          donations from generous donors. I will be helping the organization this semester with 
          optimizing their technology platforms.
